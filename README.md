Scraping Cars24: Extracting Key Insights from Used Car Listings
This project involves web scraping data from Cars24 to extract, clean, and analyze information about used car listings. The goal is to gain actionable insights such as price trends, brand performance, and mileage comparisons, which can be valuable for buyers, sellers, and automotive market researchers.

📌 Project Overview
Objective:
To collect data from Cars24 used car listings and perform data analysis to identify trends and patterns in the used car market.

Key Features:
✅ Web scraping Cars24 car listings (brand, model, year, mileage, price, fuel type, etc.)
✅ Data cleaning and preprocessing for accurate analysis
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover key trends
✅ Visualization of insights (price distribution, brand-wise analysis, mileage vs. price correlation)

🛠 Technologies Used
Python Libraries:

requests, BeautifulSoup – for web scraping

pandas, numpy – for data manipulation

matplotlib, seaborn – for data visualization
